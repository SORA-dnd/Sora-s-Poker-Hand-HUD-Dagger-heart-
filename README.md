# Sora-s-Poker-Hand-HUD-Dagger-heart-
Poker-hand style item HUD with a customizable status bar, integrated assets, and visual effects.
You can open the HUD by clicking the bookmark button on the left side of the screen (the bookmark's position can be adjusted in the settings).If you don't have a token selected, the HUD will automatically display the first character you own (convenient for "theater of the mind" style play).If you are the GM, the HUD will display for your selected token (you may need to click the "Reset" button to refresh the character).

You can scroll through your cards using the mouse wheel. Use the top buttons (like Config, Items, etc.) to view different types of cards, and left-click any card to view its corresponding item sheet.
For "Domain Cards," you can right-click to select five cards and then click "Confirm" to build your "Domain Card Hand," which will sync with your character sheet. After your hand is confirmed, you can right-click a Domain Card to use it. For other items and features, you can always left-click to view them and right-click to use them.
You can double-click the token portrait in the center of the HUD to open your character sheet. You can also quickly modify some of your character's stats using the resource trackers to the left of the portrait.
